## How to Play Gemcraft Labyrinth
 
Gemcraft Labyrinth is a game that requires strategy and skill. Here are some tips and tricks to help you play better:

- Learn the basics of gem crafting. You can create gems by dragging them from the inventory to an empty slot on the field. You can also combine two gems of the same grade by dragging one onto another. Combining gems increases their power and adds their special abilities. You can also upgrade gems by spending mana.
- Use different types of gems for different purposes. There are eight types of gems in Gemcraft Labyrinth: bloodbound, chain hit, critical hit, lime, mana leeching, multiple damage, poison, and slowing. Each type has its own advantages and disadvantages. For example, bloodbound gems deal more damage as they kill more enemies, but they also cost more mana to create and upgrade. Chain hit gems can hit multiple enemies with one shot, but they have lower damage and range. Experiment with different combinations of gems to find out what works best for you.
- Build towers and traps wisely. Towers are structures that hold gems and shoot at enemies. Traps are structures that hold gems and activate when enemies step on them. You can build towers and traps anywhere on the field by spending mana. You can also move them around by dragging them with the mouse. Towers and traps have different strengths and weaknesses. For example, towers have longer range and faster firing rate, but they are more expensive and vulnerable to flying enemies. Traps have shorter range and slower firing rate, but they are cheaper and can affect all enemies regardless of their type or speed. Use both towers and traps strategically to cover all angles of attack.
- Manage your mana carefully. Mana is the resource that you use to create and upgrade gems, build towers 8cf37b1e13
